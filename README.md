# Hydroponics
Information material and central place where I collect my projects and experiments around [hydroponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics).

## Background Information

The webpage [Pflanzenfabrik.de](https://pflanzenfabrik.de) is a great place to start (if you're speaking the german language).

It has very basic and more advanced articles to read about.
